##Software Development

Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing,
programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and 
maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components. Software 
development is a process of writing and maintaining the source code, but in a 
broader sense, it includes all that is involved between the conception of the 
desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, sometimes 
in a planned and structured process.Therefore, software development may 
include research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, 
re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software 
products.
